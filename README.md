## Description

The Goal Based Financial Planner is a pure front-end application designed to help users set and track financial goals. Users can input their financial objectives, choose the allocation ratio of how they want to invest into various categories, and the planner will calculate and display how much they should be investing into each category to meet their goals. This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for financial planning without requiring any backend services.

**Note:** This project is still a work in progress. We are actively developing new features and improving the user experience.
