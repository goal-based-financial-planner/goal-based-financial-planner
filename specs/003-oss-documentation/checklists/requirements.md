# Specification Quality Checklist: Open Source Project Documentation Standards

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Validation Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: ✓ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Details:
- All 16 checklist items validated successfully
- Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic
- Three prioritized user stories provide independent, testable value
- 12 functional requirements are clear and unambiguous
- 8 success criteria are measurable and outcome-focused
- No implementation details leaked into specification

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults based on OSS standards
